	Do you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, government plans such as Medicare, or Indian Health Service? All survey respondents were asked this question.
</div><div><h4 title="">Weighted Survey Data</h4>
		The data reported above were produced by weighting the sample to better represent the Maryland population age 18 and older. All percentages, confidence intervals, and population estimates are based on weighted data.

		2018 Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, accessed at https://ibis.health.maryland.gov on [INSERT DATE ACCESSED].  
	</li></ul></div><div><h3 title="">Data Issues</h3><div><h4 title="">Survey Sample</h4>
		The survey is conducted using scientific telephone survey methods to collect data from Maryland adults age 18 and older who are not living in institutional settings such as nursing homes, military barracks, or prisons. Since 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has weighted survey results by a statistical process called iterative proportional fitting (also called raking) to account for demographic differences between the survey sample and Maryland's adult population. Please visit www.cdc.gov/brfss for additional information about telephone data collection and weighting methodologies.
	</div><div><h4 title="">Denominator</h4>
		The denominator includes all survey respondents ages 18 years and older except those with missing, don't know and refused answers. If the query was limited to a particular sub-population-group, only those respondents are included in the denominator.
	</div><div><h4 title="">Results Grouped by Second indicator</h4>
		When grouping results by a second indicator, the results displayed are percentages of second indicator that included/met criteria of first or primary indicator. Note the Query Criteria at top of page.
